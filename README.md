## üìùNext Steps ‚Äì Blockchain Integration

We are now transitioning into full blockchain integration using **ThirdWeb** for deployment and interaction with smart contracts. The goal is to build a seamless bridge between decentralized smart contract logic and Firebase for real-time data management.

### Smart Contract Deployment Plan

We will deploy and connect the following modules:

- Donor Registration Contract  
- Patient Registration Contract  
- Organ Matching Contract  
- Hospital Verification Contract  
- Transaction Management Contract

### Integration Objectives

- Connect donor registration with smart contracts  
- Implement automated organ matching via on-chain logic  
- Store hospital verification status on-chain  
- Enable transparent donation tracking  
- Integrate hospital verification and transplant approval workflows  

### Web3 Features To Be Added

- Wallet connection and management (MetaMask/WalletConnect)  
- Gas fee estimation and transaction cost handling  
- Transaction status tracking and user confirmations  
- Block confirmation and finality tracking  
- Smart contract event subscription for real-time updates

### Smart Contract Functional Goals

#### Donor Management
- Register donors on-chain  
- Track organ availability and status (Active/Deceased)  
- Maintain donation history per donor  

#### Patient Management
- Register patients on-chain  
- Track organ requirements and priority  
- Maintain and manage dynamic waiting lists  

#### Hospital Operations
- Verify hospitals on-chain  
- Confirm matches and transplants  
- Maintain blockchain-based transplant records  

#### Matching System
- Implement automatic organ matching algorithm  
- Prioritize based on urgency, blood compatibility, and HLA match  
- Ensure fair and medically compatible allocation
